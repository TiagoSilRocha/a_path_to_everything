# Life Advice for Tech, Fitness, Finance, and more.

Welcome to my repository where I share my personal insights and advice on breaking into the tech industry, leveraging apps for efficiency, staying fit, and managing finances. 

The worst thing in life is having no money, no friends, no family, and no purpose. It also kind of sucks to have just one of those things. 

But again, combine this with 999 other people's advice and sprinkle in your own life experience. Fork this. Make a merge request. Add more!

## Mindset Tips
- You can do this. I grew up on welfare, no parents, and a lot of imposter syndrome. Hard work truly does beat natural talent. I've had a very non linear career.
- I haven't "made it." I am still on the journey, but I am sharing tips below that have taken me from a scarcity mindset to a growth mindset.
- Opportunity is out there. You need to take baby steps towards your dreams every day. With proper tools and technology these days. It has never been easier to make a daily dent in your goals.

Do you need a more formal version of this advice?

- **Embrace Your Journey**: Remember, everyone's path is unique. My journey, from welfare to overcoming imposter syndrome, proves that resilience and hard work can surpass inherent talent.
- **Celebrate Continuous Growth**: Success isn't a destination but a journey. I'm still on my path, sharing insights that helped me transition from a scarcity mindset to embracing growth and possibilities.
- **Take Daily Steps Towards Dreams**: In today's world, brimming with tools and technology, it's easier than ever to make small yet significant strides towards your goals every day. Embrace these resources and let them propel you forward.

Long story short, drink a tall glass of figure it the *** out. You have to want whatever your goal is, but I get it! It's lonely out there trying for something your friends might look down on. People don't always encourage you when you're doing well. 

Find new friends. Care less about what others think, and work towards what you know is right for you. And if you don't know what you want emulate those that inspire you and take baby steps in the right direction.

You don't know what career you want, but you know 80% of jobs involve computers. Learn about computers so you can either draw art on them or code on them. 

You don't know where you want to live, but you know it's not where you are. Go visit a place, any place. Learn and experience more. I used to be deadly afraid of a 20 minute drive down the road. Not actually afraid of driving, but how inefficient it might be to go to X place when I could stick with my old routine that got X thing done faster. Try something new. It could lead to an overall better life.

## Apps for Efficiency
In today's fast-paced world, efficiency is key. Here are some incredible apps that can significantly boost your productivity and time management skills.

### Speechify
- **What it does**: Transforms text into speech, allowing you to listen to articles, emails, and documents on the go.
- **Why it's great**: Ideal for multitasking and consuming information while commuting or exercising.
  - You know when someone gives you some giant PDF to read, and you never do? This has changed the game for me. It is worth paying for. I have literally saved so much time just binging some white paper on 2X speed while driving.
  - I will say AIR PODS PRO are also a requirement. I live with these in my ears a big chunk of the day.
  - I will come back and write more about how much speechify has changed my life.
  - I hope you're reading this page on Speechify!
 
### Audible

  - I probably went a solid 10 years without reading a book. It is sad. I know. But since getting audible I have consumed 100's of books. 14 -20 bucks to get a book someone spent 1-5 years sitting there debating over and trying to empty their life experience in to.
  

### Blinkist

### Nutrition and Diet

- Biking to work
  - I biked to work for 5 years in Boston and it was the best years.
  - This article kicked my ass to finally do it: https://semi-rad.com/2011/06/9-reasons-why-you-should-never-bike-to-work/
  - God forbid, you give up the 45 minutes of driving and visits to gym after work! How could you possibly avoid getting wet!
  - Isn't it cold outside?! People will ask! Jacket's haven't been invented yet!
  - Jokes aside.
      - Safety! People have died on bikes. I will say this. You have the option to get off roads on dangerous parts and be a pedestrian. In 5 years, I never put myself near large vehicles and I avoided narrow roads when conditions were not safe. I never once felt unsafe. 
  - But seriously, the 30-45 minutes on my bike, weaving through city traffic, listening to music, with the low hum of city chatter. It was a thrill. I hope to move back to biking to work. But for now, I am enjoying remote work and walking to the office when I need to go in.

## Finance Tips
### Budgeting
- Budgeting Methods
  - Build a Lifetime budget. Yes you think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
      - Link to my lifetime budget calculator: <Pending>
      - There are so many decisions about how you plan to live your life, when you plan to retire, how much income you'd like to have. These assumptions are pivotal in terms of making smart decisions today.
      - It seems like a daunting task, but actually saves your hundreds if not years of working time.
      - It allows for things life work hiatuses, i.e. you planned your life and aim to save 20K per year. You can save 40K one year and take an entire year off!
      - <More details pending>
- Bloggers that changed my financial life
  - I can't possibly write as good of information as the below bloggers who changed my life:
